### Description:

This repository contains our school project for the Enterprise Development Experience class. Our project, titled "BNBs - Bed & Breakfast Management System" is designed to demonstrate our understanding of enterprise-level application development using microservices architecture. We have implemented four microservices that collectively form a comprehensive Bed & Breakfast management system.

### Microservices:

Name | Description | Database (port) | API Port
---|---|---|---
Bnb | Bed and breakfast companies | MySQL (3307) | 8080
Room | Rooms available in a BnB | MongoDB (27017) | 8085
Reservation | Reservations made under a Bnb | MySQL (3306) | 8090
Person | Owners, customers, staff that are in the system | MongoDB (27018) | 8095
